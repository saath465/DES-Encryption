# Information Security Algorithms and Techniques.

# DES
DES encryption & decryption and associated modes of operation.
This is program in python to implement the Sdes & modes of operations.
The program is built in eclipse Neon edition and uses pydev environment.
The modules included are:
ECB_Mode,
CBC_mode,
OFB_mode,
CTR_mode,
SdesEncrypt (for encryption and decryption),
DES_modes (for all operations from input to output)...
#load all modules in the eclipse environment and execute DES module.
Input format ::: abcdefghij 1110001110.

# Stegnography Technique
Python Codes: 
steg_final.py
dec.py
mesg_encode.py
The program is used to embed information in a .png image file by checking the hex values of the 
Blue color range of the r,g,b pixels.
The assoiciated programs are used to convert the string to binary and back to string after decoding.
Input Format : abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 1234567890.

The programs are built in Visual Studio 2015, and built to a release version.
The usage of the program is:  ./malware.exe "dll_path" "PID"
The programs are: malware_injection.cpp and Dll_injection.cpp
